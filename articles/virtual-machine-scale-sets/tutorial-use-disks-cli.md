# Tutorial: Create and use disks with Virtual Machine Scale Set with the Azure CLI
Virtual Machine Scale Sets use disks to store the Virtual Machine (VM) instance's operating system, applications, and data. As you create and manage a scale set, it's important to choose a disk size and configuration appropriate to the expected workload. This tutorial covers how to create and manage VM disks. In this tutorial, you learn about:

> * Disk performance
> * Attach and prepare data disks

- This article requires version 2.0.29 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Default Azure disks
Most VM SKUs include a temporary local disk that is created automatically and added to the Virtual Machine Scale Set instance when scaling occurs. However, there are SKUs available that don't utilize a temporary disk. In that case, a scaling operation doesn't automatically create and add the temporary disk to a newly created instance. For more information on VM SKUs that do and do not utilize temporary disks, see [Azure VM sizes with no local temporary disk](../virtual-machines/azure-vms-no-temp-disk.yml).

**Operating system disk** - Operating system disks can be sized up to 2 TB, and hosts the VM instance's operating system. By default, the OS disk is labeled */dev/sda* on Linux and *C:* on Windows. The disk caching configuration of the OS disk is optimized for OS performance. Because of this configuration, the OS disk **should not** host applications or data. For applications and data, use data disks, which are detailed later in this article.

**Temporary disk** - Temporary disks use a solid-state drive that is located on the same Azure host as the VM instance. Temporary disks are high-performance disks and might be used for operations such as temporary data processing. However, if the VM instance is moved to a new host, any data stored on a temporary disk is removed. The VM instance size determines the size of the temporary disk.

## Azure data disks
Extra data disks can be added if you need to install applications and store data. Data disks should be used in any situation where durable and responsive data storage is desired. Each data disk has a maximum capacity of 4 TB. The size of the VM instance determines how many data disks can be attached. For each VM vCPU, two data disks can be attached up to an absolute maximum of 64 disks per virtual machine.

## VM disk types
Azure provides two types of disk.

### Standard disk
Backed by HDDs or SSDs, standard storage delivers cost-effective storage and performance. Standard disks are ideal for cost effective development and test workloads.

### Premium disk
Premium disks are backed by SSD-based high-performance, low-latency disk. These disks are recommended for VMs that run production workloads. Premium Storage supports DS-series, DSv2-series, GS-series, and FS-series VMs. For more information, see [Azure managed disk types](../virtual-machines/disks-types.md).

## Create and attach disks
You can create and attach disks when you create a scale set, or with an existing scale set.

As of API version `2019-07-01`, you can set the size of the OS disk in a Virtual Machine Scale Set with the [storageProfile.osDisk.diskSizeGb](/rest/api/compute/virtualmachinescalesets/createorupdate#virtualmachinescalesetosdisk) property. After provisioning, you might have to expand or repartition the disk to make use of the whole space. Learn more about how to expand the volume in your OS in either [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/expand-os-disk.md#expand-the-volume-in-the-operating-system) or [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/expand-disks.md#expand-a-disk-partition-and-filesystem).

### Attach disks at scale set creation

First, create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group) command. In this example, a resource group named *myResourceGroup* is created in the *eastus* region.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Create a Virtual Machine Scale Set with the [az vmss create](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-create) command. The following example creates a scale set named *myScaleSet*, and generates SSH keys if they don't exist. Two disks are created with the `--data-disk-sizes-gb` parameter. The first disk is *64* GB in size, and the second disk is 128-GB:

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myScaleSet \
  --image Ubuntu2204 \
  --orchestration-mode Flexible \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --data-disk-sizes-gb 64 128
```

It takes a few minutes to create and configure all the scale set resources and VM instances.

### Attach a disk to existing scale set
You can also attach extra disks to each instance in an existing scale set. To add another disk with [az vmss disk attach](/cli/azure/vmss/disk#az-vmss-disk-attach), use the scale set created in the previous step. The following example attaches another 128-GB disk:

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss disk attach \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vmss-name myScaleSet \
  --size-gb 128
```

Alternatively, if you want to add a data disk to an individual instance in a scale set, use [az vm disk attach](/cli).

```azurecli-interactive
az vm disk attach \
  --vm-name myScaleSet_Instance1 \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --size-gb 30 \
  --name disk_name \
  --new
```

## List attached disks
To view information about disks attached to a scale set, use [az vmss show](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-show) and query on *virtualMachineProfile.storageProfile.dataDisks*:

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss show \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myScaleSet \
  --query virtualMachineProfile.storageProfile.dataDisks
```

Information on the disk size, storage tier, and LUN (Logical Unit Number) is shown. The following example output details the three data disks attached to the scale set:

```json
[
  {
    "additionalProperties": {},
    "caching": "None",
    "createOption": "Empty",
    "diskSizeGb": 64,
    "lun": 0,
    "managedDisk": {
      "additionalProperties": {},
      "storageAccountType": "StandardSSD_LRS"
    },
    "name": null
  },
  {
    "additionalProperties": {},
    "caching": "None",
    "createOption": "Empty",
    "diskSizeGb": 128,
    "lun": 1,
    "managedDisk": {
      "additionalProperties": {},
      "storageAccountType": "StandardSSD_LRS"
    },
    "name": null
  },
  {
    "additionalProperties": {},
    "caching": "None",
    "createOption": "Empty",
    "diskSizeGb": 128,
    "lun": 2,
    "managedDisk": {
      "additionalProperties": {},
      "storageAccountType": "StandardSSD_LRS"
    },
    "name": null
  }
]
```

## Detach a disk
When you no longer need a given disk, you can detach it from the scale set. The disk is removed from all VM instances in the scale set. To detach a disk from a scale set, use [az vmss disk detach](/cli/azure/vmss/disk#az-vmss-disk-detach) and specify the LUN of the disk. The LUNs are shown in the output from [az vmss show](/cli/azure/vmss#az-vmss-show) in the previous section. The following example detaches LUN *2* from the scale set:

```azurecli-interactive
az vmss disk detach \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myScaleSet \
  --lun 2
```

You can also use [az vm disk detach](/cli/azure/vmss/disk#az-vmss-disk-detac) to detach a disk from an individual instance. 

```azurepowershell-interactive
az vm disk detach \
  --vm-name myScaleSet_Instance1
  --name disk_name
```

## Clean up resources
To remove your scale set and disks, delete the resource group and all its resources with [az group delete](/cli/azure/group). The `--no-wait` parameter returns control to the prompt without waiting for the operation to complete. The `--yes` parameter confirms that you wish to delete the resources without another prompt to do so.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup --no-wait --yes
```
