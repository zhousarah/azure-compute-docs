- Only supported for data disks.
- If a Standard HDD, Standard SSD, or Premium SSD disk is 4 TiB or less, deallocate your VM and detach the disk before expanding it beyond 4 TiB. If one of those disk types is already greater than 4 TiB, you can expand it without deallocating the VM and detaching the disk. This doesn't apply to Premium SSD v2 or Ultra Disks.
- Not supported for shared disks.
- Install and use either:
    - The [latest Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
    - The [latest Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell)
    - The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
    - Or an Azure Resource Manager template with an API version that's `2021-04-01` or newer.
- Not available on some classic VMs. Use [this script](#expanding-without-downtime-classic-vm-sku-support) to get a list of classic VM SKUs that support expanding without downtime.

### Expand with Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2

Expanding Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 disks have the following additional limitations:
- You can't expand a disk while a [background copy](../scripts/create-managed-disk-from-snapshot.md#performance-impact---background-copy-process) of data is also occurring on that disk, like when a disk is being hydrated from snapshots.
- You can't expand a VM that's using [NVMe controllers](../nvme-overview.md) for Ultra Disks or Premium SSD v2 disks without downtime.

#### Regional availability

Resizing Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 disks is currently available in all Premium SSD v2 and Ultra supported regions except the following:

- US West 2
- West Europe
- East US
