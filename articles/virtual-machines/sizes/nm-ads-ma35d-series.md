# NMads MA35D series

The NMads MA35D-Series virtual machines are Azure's first SKU to offer specialized hardware (Xilinx MA35D "Supernova") accelerated VM optimized for batch and real-time video transcoding workloads. The VM series are powered by 4<sup>th</sup> generation AMD EPYC™ Genoa processors. It offers 1 ASIC video processing unit (VPU) with 8GB of memory in addition to 16 vCPUs, 32GB of RAM, 76GB of temporary storage, and 4Gbps of network bandwidth.

Compared with existing general-purpose CPU or GPU based solutions, the NMads MA35D-Series VM SKU provides higher throughout and lower latency while maintaining a lower TCO for customers. The VM series presents a huge opportunity to save on infrastructure costs and improve performance and efficiency on video transcoding. Additionally, the VM provides access to modern codecs such as AV1 to further improve efficiency for video processing. It is the ideal choice for running your video transcoding workloads on the cloud.

### Table definitions

Expected network bandwidth is the maximum aggregated bandwidth allocated per VM type across all NICs, for all destinations. For more information, see [Virtual machine network bandwidth](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput) 

Upper limits aren't guaranteed. Limits offer guidance for selecting the right VM type for the intended application. Actual network performance depends on several factors including network congestion, application loads, and network settings. For information on optimizing network throughput, see [Optimize network throughput for Azure virtual machines](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-optimize-network-bandwidth). 

To achieve the expected network performance on Linux or Windows, you may need to select a specific version or optimize your VM. For more information, see [Bandwidth/Throughput testing (NTTTCP)](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-bandwidth-testing).
