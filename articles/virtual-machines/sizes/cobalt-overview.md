# Azure Cobalt processor-based Virtual Machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

Cobalt 100-based Virtual Machines (VMs) are powered by Azure's first-generation Cobalt 100 processor. These VMs offer an attractive option for a wide range of scale-out and cloud-native Linux-based workloads, including data analytics, web and application servers, open-source databases, caches, and more. These VMs utilize Microsoft's first 64-bit Arm-based CPU, which was fully designed by Microsoft. The Cobalt 100 processor, based on the Arm's Neoverse N2 design, aims to enhance performance and power efficiency for broad range of workloads. Operating at 3.4 GHz, the Azure Cobalt 100 processor provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. 


## List of VM series by family
The following section lists the VM series supported by Cobalt 100 processors. To find detailed information on a series, including specifications and recommended workloads, check out the links in the *Series* column.
