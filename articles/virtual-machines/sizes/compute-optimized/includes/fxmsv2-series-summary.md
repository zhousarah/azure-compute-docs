The FXmsv2-series Virtual Machine (VM) runs on the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8573C (Emerald Rapids) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration. FXv2-series VMs features an all-core-turbo frequency up to 4.0 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and up to 1832 GiB of RAM.  The FXmsv2-series benefits workloads that are ideal for memory-intensive enterprise applications requiring a high memory to CPU ratio, high performance, high CPU clock speed, higher remote storage IOPs and throughput. Typical use-cases for FX-series are the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and SQL workloads

FXmsv2-series virtual machines don't support local storage, thus offering a lower price point for entry. You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, Premium SSDs, and Premium SSD V2 disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
